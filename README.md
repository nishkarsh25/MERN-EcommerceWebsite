  - React Router: Used for routing within the React application.
  - Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests to the backend.
  - Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom designs.

- **Backend:**
  - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment for building server-side applications.
  - Express.js: A minimalist web application framework for Node.js.
  - MongoDB: A NoSQL database for storing application data.
  - Mongoose: An elegant MongoDB object modeling tool for Node.js.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nishkarsh25/MERN-LoginAndRegistration.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project branch:

   ```bash
   git checkout <branch-name>
   ```
   Replace `<branch-name>` with the name of the branch you want to checkout.
   
3. Start the Backend Server: Launch the backend Node.js server.

   ```bash
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```
4. Start the Frontend Development Server: Run the React development server for the frontend application.

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the development server**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
2. **Open your browser** and navigate to http://localhost:5173 to view the app.

## How to Use:

Upon accessing the website, users can interact with the following pages:

- **Product Page:** Displays a list of products available for purchase.
- **Login Page:** Allows existing users to log in to their accounts.
- **Registration Page:** Enables new users to create an account and register.
- **Cart Page:** Shows the items added to the shopping cart, allowing users to manage their cart items.
- **Detail Product Page:** Provides detailed information about a specific product, including its title, price, description, and images.

Users can navigate between these pages using the provided navigation links.

## API Endpoints

The backend server exposes the following API endpoints:

- `POST /register`: Register a new user.
- `POST /login`: Log in an existing user.

1. **Product Routes (`/routes/productRouter.js`):**
   - `GET /products`: Retrieves all products.
   - `POST /products`: Creates a new product.
   - `DELETE /products/:id`: Deletes a product by ID.
   - `PUT /products/:id`: Updates a product by ID.

2. **Category Routes (`/routes/categoryRouter.js`):**
   - `GET /category`: Retrieves all categories.
   - `POST /category`: Creates a new category.
   - `DELETE /category/:id`: Deletes a category by ID.
   - `PUT /category/:id`: Updates a category by ID.

3. **User Routes (`/routes/userRouter.js`):**
   - `POST /register`: Registers a new user.
   - `POST /login`: Logs in an existing user.
   - `GET /logout`: Logs out the current user.
   - `GET /refresh_token`: Refreshes the authentication token.
   - `GET /infor`: Retrieves user information (requires authentication).

These routes define the endpoints for handling product CRUD operations, category CRUD operations, and user authentication operations in the backend server. Each route corresponds to a specific action or resource in the application.

## React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
